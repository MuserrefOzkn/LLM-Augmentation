"Interesting plant , blooming nicely outside. I wonder what it will be indoors in the winter"
Not worth the price paid.  OK but you can make your own with less trouble and it will taste better
Taste and smell are great. As far as calming me down I don't know how well that it effects me.
"there is a little chemical kick but not to bad, as far a keurig goes this is the way to buy"
The taste is OK. ive only tried it once and then it went in my pantry and it has been sitting there.
"I love this tea but I was shorted 1 bag, and I counted twice. I bought 100 and not 99."
"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it."
This is the only place where I can find the pineapple flavor. The product is great!
I've loved these things for years... but I won't buy any more!  They're now being MADE IN MEXICO.
I'm pretty sure this is just brown sugar. It is not like Sucanat. I gave it away.
I did not care for the taste of this product and could not return it. It had a very strong taste.
I did not enjoy this soup; I will try a different brand next time.
"The products is good and gets to me in good condition, however, it takes too long to be delivered."
"Wolfgang Puck's ""Breakfast in Bed"" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one."
"These things are great, I love them. I have not found a cheese snack in the US that compares."
This is basically a can of potatoes and cream.  If you're lucky you may get 3-5 tiny pieces of clam.
"I find them excellent, but I never use table salt, so I''m used to salt free food."
"They are tasty.  Yes, a number of the long sticks arrived broken, but this is not a problem for me."
3 out of my 4 cats will not touch this.  Pretty pricey for alot of gravy & grain & little meat.
Do you the taste of fruit juice or fruit drink. This one tastes like the latter.
