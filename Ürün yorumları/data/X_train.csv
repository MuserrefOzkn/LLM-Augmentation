"They're ok, but not much flavor in the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor. I might try the multigrain flavor."
i love this tea for dieting its the best i will always purchase this tea for me and my family
"Maybe I've prepared it wrong, but I haven't been happy with the taste...it is bitter."
"A nice little gift, but it's not going to get you the gift-giver of the year award or anything!"
These cannoli shells are fantastic.  Haven't found a damaged one yet and they are delicious.
My chips arrived completely pulverized.  They were shipped with no extra packing.  Bummer
take some of the salt out and i will give it 5 stars... it way too salty
All of the Happy Baby cereals are great and my grandson loves them!  Organic and good for babies!
"Dense, flavorless, chalky, barely edible. Nothing about it reminds me of s Turtle."
This product is nutritional & tasty. Simialar to Life but not as sweet.
"IF YOU LIKE YOUR POPCORN SMALL AND CRUNCHY, THIS IS FOR YOU.  I DON'T."
"Was smaller than I anticipated and does not really bounce, but my dog happily chewed on it!"
"Hard to beat this cocoa.  Taste great, and is non-fat.  Might even be good for you."
I was disappointed in the lack of flavor in this tea. I won't purchase it again.
I have found that shopping Amazon's frustration free packaging for k-cups is the best deal!
I prefer the no sugar added dried mango. This has no mango taste and the sugar is bad for you.
Excellant flavor and not to chewy. I am not a fan of the multiple layers of packaging.
I love Bigelow tea. It is hard to find decaf tea for k-cups. This is a very tasty tea.
"I use this to ""stretch"" flavored oatmeals; I found it mushy cooked in the microwave."
This is the most disgusting drink I have ever tried!  Don't buy unless you know what it is!
The gum is tart and sweet for the initial chew but the flavor is almost gone in ten minutes.
This plums are very salty. Too much salt makes it impossicle to eat. I didn't enjoy it at all.
ogs would not touch this dog food.. They will only eat Ceasers.. I guess it was just a cheap food..
This is a great Dental Chew that my dog loves so much and it is very healthy for him.
"Wolfgang Puck's ""Breakfast in Bed"" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one."
I CAN NOT RATE A PURCHASE THAT I NEVER RECEIVED AS I FIND IT HARD TO WRITE A REVIEW FOR.
Save on money. buy this hot chocolate in bulk. Its sooo good and great anytime.
"For a licorice addict this will do, but it isn't any better than Twizzlers, and might be worse."
"I never knew that the Jet Fuel flavor is so bold, but it's good in the morning."
Had hard places where ingredients weren't stirred well.  Not something I want to eat again.
my kids like all of the flavors but chocolate.  They say they just don't taste very good.
They sell this same size can at my sam's club for $34.28.  It is crazy to charge $47!
The chips are okay Not near as flavorful as the regular blue chips. Nice size bag for a family.
Tastes funky - I only tasted it once and threw the rest away. I've had much better.
"Not what I was looking for, I don't want farmed seafood...who knows what ""by-products"" they are fed."
"Well, I was envious when I gave this my dog.  It really does smell good and he loves it."
Kitty would not eat this.  We gave the whole pack to our animal shelter.
This makes a good snack for us low-carb folks.  It has a surprisingly good flavor.
so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again
"It was as good, if not better, than I was told!  Great taste!  I will puchase it again."
"Good for tea (hot), but not for coffee.  Was a little unhappy, but still good for tea, and baking!!"
"Not only is this tea beautiful as it brews, it is also delicious and refreshing."
my dogs loves the taste but i am worried to the fact that its a hawhide
"Did not care for their organic green tea at all, but their fruit teas are the best."
I am not sure if it is my brewer or the taste of this coffee.  It is a little lackluster
I like the Funky Monkey and would gladly buy more. I just cannot justify the cost ($38/pound).
Pero is hard to find in my area. Amazon had a good price and prompt delivery. GREAT!!!
Very happy with the product and shipping.  Thanks.  Always like doing business with Amazon.
I agree that this is agreat product.But I got it at King Arthur flour co.for $5.99 per pound.
My husband loves to keep some in his truck for a snack.  We are set up to get some once a quarter.
"Was not a bad snacking treat.  Has a big caramal taste, but not much of a apple flavor to it."
Is this the price for a case of 6 9 oz. packages? These are my favorite candy. I need more!
got it for Christmas for my Japanese culture loving adult son.  He liked them!
I love strong coffee but this is a little to much for me. Kind of has an after taiste to it also
My poms love these! Hard to find in stores - glad to find them online for about the same price.
"I love the Jack Link products, but this a bit on the dry side and not much of a BBQ taste."
These jerky snacks come in single serve pieces and has a lot of protein and beefy taste.
It's not very tasty. Chewing this beef jerky is like chewing sand paper. Thick cut is the way to go.
I love this tea. It is delicious. It came in a timely manner and I was very pleased.
This mochi is just ok.  Price is very high.  It can be found in any Asian market for about $1.50.
Really nice tea with a sweet taste for the sweet tooth after dinner.
Very happy with my purchase.  There's nothing like Irish Breakfast tea to get you going.
This burger is OK. You can do better at a local store. Omaha's steaks are good.<br />Buy the steaks.
This drink is okay. I thought it would taste more fruity. It tastes more carbonated and more fizzie.
Why are you selling this as a 4 oz. box when the picture shows it to be a 3oz. box?
Pop chips are great but you really have to be a garlic lover to enjoy this one as a snack.
Klein's Macadamia nuts lack the flavor and crunch that I like in a Macadamia nut.
"Buy it at your local grocery store, you will get it at least 10 days sooner, and with less stress."
"I love Popchips. However, I did not like this flavor at all. The garlic flavor was too intense."
If cooked by  directions this is excellent tasting oatmeal and it is so healthy to eat it.
"I use these at work, for the too many occasions when I do not have time for a real lunch."
I put these into the Everlasting Treat Ball and give it to my dog when I leave.  She loves them.
I have been buying this brand of coffee bean for 5 years and always have been satisfied with it.
"The perfect coffee for those who want a strong, smooth coffee without a bitter after taste. Love it!"
THis product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies!  Try Pamela's!
We love the taste but hardly any cookies are whole.  I would have given them 5 stars otherwise.
Compact storage that do what they claim to do. I wish they had a economical 8 pack version.
This horchata mix tastes nothing like horchata. There are  better alternatives if you want horchata.
"Great product - I wish you'd sell it in single bags!<br />Also, your review process is very clumsy!"
"So far so good but as they say ""Whole Cashews"", I did find 40% of them are broken and are in pieces."
