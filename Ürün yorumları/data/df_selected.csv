1,I'm pretty sure this is just brown sugar. It is not like Sucanat. I gave it away.
1,Why are you selling this as a 4 oz. box when the picture shows it to be a 3oz. box?
1,"Buy it at your local grocery store, you will get it at least 10 days sooner, and with less stress."
1,They sell this same size can at my sam's club for $34.28.  It is crazy to charge $47!
1,This is basically a can of potatoes and cream.  If you're lucky you may get 3-5 tiny pieces of clam.
